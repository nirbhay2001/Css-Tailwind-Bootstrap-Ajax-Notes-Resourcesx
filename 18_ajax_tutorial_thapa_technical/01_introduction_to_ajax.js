    What is AJAX ?
        1. AJAX --> Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
        2. AJAX is not a programming language.
        3. AJAX just uses a combination of : 
            A browser built-in XMLHttp Request object (to request data from a web server)
            JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)


    AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes.
    This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page
